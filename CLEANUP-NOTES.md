# Morpheo Codebase Cleanup Notes

This document outlines the cleanup actions performed on the Morpheo codebase to remove outdated components, tests, and examples.

## Frontend Cleanup

### Main Application Changes

- Removed demo navigation bar from `App.tsx`
- Removed routes to demo components from the main application
- Removed imports for deprecated demo components

### Demo Component Archival

Created an `archive` directory in `frontend-new/src/examples/` and moved the following files:

- `StateManagementDemo.tsx`: Archived the old state management demo
- `IntelligentComponentsDemo.tsx`: Archived the old intelligent components demo

Each archived component was modified with a header comment indicating it's deprecated and not for production use.

### TypeScript Error Resolution

Added a TypeScript declaration file at `frontend-new/src/examples/archive/archived-components.d.ts` to silence errors in archived components. This approach:

- Prevents TypeScript errors during builds while keeping archived code accessible
- Avoids modifying outdated code that's kept only for reference
- Makes it clear these components are not meant to be integrated with current code

### Documentation

Added a README file to the examples directory explaining:
- Active examples that demonstrate current patterns
- Archived examples and why they're no longer recommended
- Usage guidelines for examples in Morpheo

## Backend Cleanup

### Template Testing Cleanup

Created an `archive` directory in `backend/testing/` and moved deprecated template-related tests:

- `test_template_registry.py.old`: Tests for the deprecated template registry
- `test_template_selection.py.old`: Tests for the template selection service

### Testing Framework Documentation

Updated the `README.md` in the testing directory to:
- Better explain the current testing architecture
- Document the archive directory and its purpose
- Provide usage guidance for the current testing framework

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed routes and imports for components no longer in active use
2. **Better Organization**: Created archive directories to preserve code while making active code more obvious
3. **Improved Documentation**: Added READMEs to explain what's current vs. archived
4. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can focus on current patterns without confusion from deprecated approaches
5. **Build Stability**: Type declarations for archived code prevent TypeScript errors during builds

## Next Steps

1. Consider removing more legacy code that isn't needed for the current architecture
2. Review additional demonstration components for alignment with current patterns
3. Further consolidate testing framework to remove duplication
4. Consider moving archived code to a separate branch for historical reference while removing it from the main codebase entirely
