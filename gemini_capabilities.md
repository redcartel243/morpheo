# Gemini Model Capabilities

This document lists the capabilities of the Gemini models as found in the Google AI for Developers documentation.

*   **Text generation:** Generate text from various inputs (text, image, video, audio).
*   **Image generation:** Generate images (Note: Likely refers to Imagen models accessed via the same API ecosystem, but listed under Gemini docs).
*   **Video generation:** Generate video (Note: Likely refers to Veo models accessed via the same API ecosystem, but listed under Gemini docs).
*   **Long context:** Process large amounts of input (millions of tokens) from text, images, videos, and documents.
*   **Structured output:** Constrain model output to specific formats like JSON.
*   **Thinking:** Enable models to perform more complex reasoning (potentially involving intermediate steps or "thoughts").
*   **Function calling:** Allow the model to call external functions or APIs to retrieve or process information.
*   **Document understanding:** Process and understand content within documents (e.g., PDFs).
*   **Image understanding:** Analyze and understand the content of images.
*   **Video understanding:** Analyze and understand the content of videos.
*   **Audio understanding:** Process and understand the content of audio files.
*   **Code execution:** Execute code snippets to perform calculations or other tasks.
*   **Grounding with Google Search:** Enhance responses by incorporating information retrieved from Google Search.
*   **Context caching:** Improve performance by caching context for repeated interactions.
*   **File processing:** Upload and process various file types (Images, Audio, Video, PDF) via the Files API.
*   **Embeddings:** Generate numerical representations (embeddings) of text or other content for tasks like similarity search.
*   **Fine-tuning:** Adapt models to specific tasks or datasets.
*   **Live API:** (Experimental/Specific use case) Likely for real-time, low-latency interactions.
*   **Safety Settings:** Control content filtering based on various harm categories.
*   **System Instructions:** Provide high-level guidance to the model on its role or persona.
*   **Token Counting:** Determine the token count for prompts or responses.
