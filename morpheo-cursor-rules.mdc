# Morpheo Core Purpose

Morpheo is an AI-driven component system with a fundamental principle:

## No Hardcoded Application Logic

1. **Zero Application-Specific Code**: No hardcoded calculator logic, growing button logic, etc.

2. **Pure AI-Driven Generation**:
   - The AI analyzes requests and determines needed components
   - The AI creates connections and transformations
   - The AI applies behaviors appropriate to the use case

3. **Generic Component System**:
   - Components should be generic building blocks
   - Behaviors should be reusable across applications
   - No component or behavior should be tied to a specific application type

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Avoid application type enums or switch statements based on application types
2. Do not create specialized handler methods for specific applications (no createCalculatorApp, etc.)
3. All component selection, connection, and behavior must come from the AI
4. The system provides only the tools and framework - the AI provides the application logic
